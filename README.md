I ensured that the partial code was secure via proper testing procedures within JUnit test classes. All functions of the program should be tested for proper error handling and input 
validation, in addition to verifying the functionality of the process. Interpreting user needs happens at the analysis level; however, understanding usability is an important aspect 
to test. The user experience needs to be seamless for new users to comprehend the ins and outs. This is why it's important to approach programs from top to bottom, with testing 
after every milestone, similar to the agile development process.
